        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am Lance, a 21-year-old with the skills of a bonafide marine who has recently developed an interest in software engineering.
            I spent a few years in the marines, focusing on fighter aircraft maintenance, which taught me discipline and attention to detailâ€”skills
            that I believe will greatly contribute to my new venture. When not studying, I enjoy playing strategic battles on StarCraft 2. 
            I share my life with my wife, Allie, and our two lively cats, Boots and Leaky Butt. 
            Transitioning from the strict discipline of the marines to the logical realm of software engineering 
            has been an exciting journey.

        <h2>About Page</h2>
        <p>
          On this page I have integrated key components learned in class to build this webpage.
          The top of the page includes links to previous work, and below more information on what was learned in class so far.
          Navigating to the middle and bottom of the page you'll see more information about myself, a contact box and the current box you're reading.
          The key components used to make this page are as follows: HTML, Semantic tags, Style.CSS, CSS flexbox, CSS float and position, Github and Gitbash.
          All of the code was written and edited in VsCode.
