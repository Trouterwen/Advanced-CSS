# Advanced-CSS
I created a portfolio for myself and gave details on the topics and codes I have learned in class.
On the page, I have included snippets of different topics covered in class and what I have learned from them.
At the top of the page, I included links to previous works with topics learned from class applied to each. 
In addition, there is a link to this repo on Git Hub. Below the learned course section there is an about me, 
contact me, and about page sections all with their corresponding information. In the contact me section 
I have included hyperlinks to different social media sites. The file to the CSS code is in the assets folder.

Here is a link to the repo:  https://github.com/Trouterwen/Advanced-CSS
